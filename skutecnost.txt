In our project retrospective, it's clear that we underestimated deadlines, leading to a rush in implementation during the final weeks. 
Instead of adhering to our planned task division, team members worked on tasks randomly without clear allocation.

Moving forward, we need to improve our deadline estimation and ensure clearer task distribution to avoid last-minute rushes and inefficiencies.
